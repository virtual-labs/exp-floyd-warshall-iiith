        "c": "It can handle both negative edges and negative cycles",
        "d": "It has a lower time complexity"
      },
      "explanations": {
        "b": "Floyd Warshall has more time complexity than dijkstra's algorithm but it can handle negative edges, the algorithm can't handle negative cycles."

      "explanations": {
        "b": "The approach used in Floyd Warshall algorithm is bottom up approach.This approach uses the tabulation technique to implement the dynamic programming solution. It addresses the same problems as before, but without recursion"
