        "a" : "One of the way to find transitive closure of a graph is to use Floyd Warshall algorithm. Just assign weight of each edge as 1 and run Floyd Warshall algorithm."

        "a": "If the element on the diagonal of the matrix is negative, then there is a negative weight cycle in the graph."
